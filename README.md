# STM32 IMU Visualizer üöÄ

Welcome to the STM32 IMU Visualizer repository! This project focuses on creating a 3D visualization system for BMI160 IMU sensor data using STM32 with FreeRTOS and a Python/OpenGL frontend. If you are interested in accelerometer, gyroscope, sensor fusion, embedded systems, and more, this project is for you!

## Repository Details ‚ÑπÔ∏è

- **Repository Name:** STM32-IMU-Visualizer
- **Description:** 3D visualization system for BMI160 IMU sensor data using STM32 with FreeRTOS and Python/OpenGL frontend
- **Topics:** accelerometer, c, embedded, embedded-systems, freertos, gyroscope, i2c, imu, lcd, opengl, pygame, python, sensor-fusion, stm32, uart

## Project Overview üåü

This project involves interfacing with a BMI160 IMU sensor using an STM32 microcontroller and gathering accelerometer and gyroscope data. The data is then processed and sent to a Python frontend using UART communication. The Python application utilizes OpenGL to create a 3D visualization of the sensor data, providing a dynamic and interactive way to understand the sensor readings.

## How to Use üìù

To get started with the STM32 IMU Visualizer project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Set up the STM32 development environment with FreeRTOS support.
3. Build and flash the STM32 firmware to interface with the BMI160 IMU sensor.
4. Launch the Python/OpenGL frontend to visualize the sensor data in 3D.
